Contentful AR SDK Sample based on Google AR SDK
===========================================

This is a demo of using Contentful with the Google AR SDK. 

## What is Contentful?

[Contentful](https://www.contentful.com) provides a content infrastructure for digital teams to power content in websites, apps, and devices. Unlike a CMS, Contentful was built to integrate with the modern software stack. It offers a central hub for structured content, powerful management and delivery APIs, and a customizable web app that enable developers and content creators to ship digital products faster.
