Contentful AR SDK Sample based on Google AR SDK
===========================================

This is a demo of using Contentful with the Google AR SDK. 

## What is Contentful?

[Contentful](https://www.contentful.com) provides a content infrastructure for digital teams to power content in websites, apps, and devices. Unlike a CMS, Contentful was built to integrate with the modern software stack. It offers a central hub for structured content, powerful management and delivery APIs, and a customizable web app that enable developers and content creators to ship digital products faster.

## Use it in the web app?

There was a Ui extension written by the same author of this adoption of the demo, to ease the usage of obj files in the contentful web app. Please head [over there](https://github.com/mariobodemann/contentful-extensions-3d-model-viewer) in order to install it.
